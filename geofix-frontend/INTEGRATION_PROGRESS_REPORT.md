## 🔄 DATA FLOW STATUS

### ✅ **Working Flow (Partially)**:

```
1. CITIZEN Reports Issue ✅
   └─> Backend: POST /api/tickets
   └─> Status: PENDING

2. ADMIN Assigns to Contractor ⏸️ (Next to integrate)
   └─> Backend: PUT /api/tickets/{id}/assign-contractor/{contractorId}
   └─> Status: ASSIGNED_TO_CONTRACTOR

3. CONTRACTOR Assigns to Worker ⏸️ (Next to integrate)
   └─> Backend: PUT /api/contractor/tickets/{id}/assign
   └─> Status: ASSIGNED_TO_WORKER

4. WORKER Starts & Completes Work ✅
   └─> Backend: PUT /api/worker/tasks/{id} (IN_PROGRESS)
   └─> Backend: PUT /api/worker/tasks/{id} (COMPLETED + photo)
   └─> Status: COMPLETED

5. CITIZEN Views Completion ⏸️ (Next to integrate)
   └─> Backend: GET /api/tickets/my-tickets
   └─> View completed ticket
```

## 📝 INTEGRATION PATTERN ESTABLISHED

From the worker tasks page integration, we've established this pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Import services
import workerService, { WorkerTask } from "@/services/workerService";

// 2. Add state for data, loading, error
const [data, setData] = useState<DataType[]>([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

// 3. Load data on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const loadData = async () => {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      setError(null);
      const result = await service.getData();
      setData(result);
    } catch (err: any) {
      setError(err.message || "Failed to load data");
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };
  loadData();
}, []);

// 4. Handle actions with error handling
const handleAction = async () => {
  try {
    setActionLoading(true);
    await service.performAction();
    await loadData(); // Reload after action
  } catch (err: any) {
    setError(err.message);
  } finally {
    setActionLoading(false);
  }
};

// 5. Show loading state
if (loading) {
  return <Loader2 className="animate-spin" />;
}

// 6. Show error alert
{
  error && <Alert variant="destructive">{error}</Alert>;
}
```

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & WORKAROUNDS

### Backend Gaps:

1. **User Management Endpoints** - Not implemented

   - `suspendUser()` - Currently mocked with warning
   - `activateUser()` - Currently mocked with warning
   - `getAllUsers()` - Uses aggregated data workaround

2. **Rating System** - Not in backend
   - Worker ratings shown as mock data
   - Will need backend endpoints in future

### Frontend Workarounds:

1. **getAllUsers()** - Aggregates from tickets and contractors
2. **Performance stats** - Calculated client-side from task data
3. **Photo URLs** - Helper method handles both relative and absolute URLs
