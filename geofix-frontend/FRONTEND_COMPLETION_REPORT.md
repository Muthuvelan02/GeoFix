**Reason**: All frontend pages are ready. Time to make them functional.

**Tasks**:

1. Create `adminService.ts` with all admin endpoints
2. Create `workerService.ts` with task management endpoints
3. Extend `ticketService.ts` with missing methods
4. Replace all mock data with real API calls
5. Test complete workflows:
   - Citizen reports issue
   - Admin assigns to contractor
   - Contractor assigns to worker
   - Worker completes task
   - Citizen sees completion

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### Option B: Create Superadmin Pages

**Priority**: LOW  
**Reason**: You asked to skip this for now.
