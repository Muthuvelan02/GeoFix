## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS - YOUR CHOICE**

### Option A: Create Remaining Pages (Frontend Only)

**Still needed:**

- Admin - User Management
- Admin - Analytics Dashboard
- Admin - Reports Generation
- Superadmin - Admin Verification
- Superadmin - Platform Analytics
- Citizen - Ticket Detail View

**I can create these** following the same pattern you used!

### Option B: Backend Integration (Recommended)

**Now that we have 5 solid pages**, we can:

1. Create service files (adminService.ts, workerService.ts)
2. Replace mock data with real API calls
3. Test the workflow:
   - Admin assigns ticket to contractor ✅
   - Contractor assigns to worker ✅
   - Worker completes task ✅
   - Citizen tracks progress ✅

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

1. Create 2-3 more critical pages (Admin Analytics, Citizen Detail View)
2. Then start backend integration
3. Finish remaining pages later

---

## 💡 **MY RECOMMENDATION**

**Go with Option B** - Backend Integration!

**Why?**

- You have the core workflow pages ready
- 5 high-quality pages is enough to test the system
- Better to have working features than more mock pages
- You can add remaining pages after integration

**What I'll do:**

1. Create `adminService.ts` with all admin API methods
2. Create `workerService.ts` with worker API methods
3. Update `ticketService.ts` with missing methods
4. Replace mock data in all 5 pages
5. Test end-to-end workflow
6. Then create remaining pages with real data
