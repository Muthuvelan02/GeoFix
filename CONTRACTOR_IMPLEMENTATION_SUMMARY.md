5. **Performance** - Track your work statistics and team performance

### Development Notes:

- All pages use TypeScript with strict typing
- Protected routes with role verification
- Centralized API calls through service layer
- Consistent error handling
- No backend modifications made (as requested)

## üìä Key Metrics Tracked

1. **Ticket Metrics**

   - Total tickets assigned
   - Tickets waiting to be assigned to workers
   - Tickets assigned to workers
   - Tickets in progress
   - Completed tickets
   - Completion rate percentage

2. **Worker Metrics**
   - Total workers
   - Active workers
   - Average tickets per worker

## ‚ú® Best Practices Followed

1. **No File Clutter**: Only created necessary files
2. **Component Reuse**: Used existing UI components
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages
5. **Professional UI**: Maintained design consistency
6. **Next.js 14**: Proper use of App Router and client components
7. **Clean Code**: Well-organized and documented

## üîÑ Next Steps to Test

1. Start the Next.js development server:

   ```powershell
   cd geofix-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Login as a contractor

3. Test each page:
   - Dashboard loads with statistics
   - Can add new workers
   - Can view and search workers
   - Can remove workers
   - Can view assigned tickets
   - Can assign tickets to workers
   - Can view performance metrics
