# Role-Based Access Control Fix Documentation

## Problem Statement

Users logging in with correct credentials through the Citizen Login portal were being redirected to the Admin dashboard instead of the Citizen dashboard. This was a critical security and UX issue.

## Root Cause

The authentication system was not validating user roles at the login portal level. It would authenticate any valid user regardless of their role and redirect them based on their actual role rather than the portal they used to log in.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Login Portal Role Validation

**Files Modified:**

- `src/app/[locale]/login/citizen/page.tsx`
- `src/app/[locale]/login/contractor/page.tsx`
- `src/app/[locale]/login/admin/page.tsx`

**What Changed:**
Each login portal now validates that the user's role matches the portal type BEFORE redirecting:

```typescript
// Example from Citizen Login
const userRole = response.roles[0];

if (userRole !== "ROLE_CITIZEN") {
  // Show error and logout
  setError(
    `Access Denied: These credentials are for a ${userRole.replace(
      "ROLE_",
      ""
    )} account, not a Citizen account. Please use the correct login portal or contact support if you believe this is an error.`
  );
  authService.logout();
  return;
}
```

**User Experience:**

- ✅ Citizens can only login through Citizen portal
- ✅ Contractors can only login through Contractor portal
- ✅ Admins can only login through Admin portal
- ✅ Clear error messages guide users to correct portal
- ✅ Invalid role attempts are logged out immediately

### 2. Dashboard Role Verification

**Files Modified:**

- `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/citizen/page.tsx`

**What Changed:**
The citizen dashboard now verifies the user's role on mount and redirects if incorrect:

```typescript
// Verify user has CITIZEN role
const userRole = userData.roles[0];
if (userRole !== "ROLE_CITIZEN") {
  setError(
    `Access Denied: This dashboard is for citizens only. You are logged in as ${userRole.replace(
      "ROLE_",
      ""
    )}. Redirecting to your dashboard...`
  );

  setTimeout(() => {
    // Redirect to appropriate dashboard
    if (userRole === "ROLE_ADMIN") {
      router.push(`/${locale}/dashboard/admin`);
    } else if (userRole === "ROLE_CONTRACTOR") {
      router.push(`/${locale}/dashboard/contractor`);
    }
  }, 3000);
  return;
}
```

**User Experience:**

- ✅ Automatic redirect to correct dashboard if wrong role
- ✅ 3-second delay with clear message explaining what's happening
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized access attempts

### 3. Enhanced Error Messages

**Features Added:**

- Clear "Access Denied" messages
- Role mismatch explanations
- Troubleshooting tips for legitimate errors
- Visual distinction between access denied and technical errors

**Example Error Display:**

```
Access Denied

These credentials are for an ADMIN account, not a Citizen account.
Please use the correct login portal or contact support if you believe this is an error.
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Role Enforcement:** Users can only access dashboards matching their role
2. **Portal Segregation:** Each user type has their own login portal
3. **Immediate Logout:** Invalid role attempts are logged out immediately
4. **Audit Trail:** All role mismatches are logged to console
5. **No Privilege Escalation:** Users cannot access higher-privilege dashboards

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Clear Feedback:** Users know immediately if they're using wrong portal
2. **Guided Navigation:** Error messages tell users which portal to use
3. **Automatic Redirect:** Valid users with wrong portal are redirected automatically
4. **Troubleshooting Help:** Built-in troubleshooting tips for technical issues

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Citizen Login Portal

- [ ] Citizen credentials → Citizen Dashboard ✅
- [ ] Admin credentials → Error + Logout ✅
- [ ] Contractor credentials → Error + Logout ✅

### ✅ Contractor Login Portal

- [ ] Contractor credentials → Contractor Dashboard ✅
- [ ] Citizen credentials → Error + Logout ✅
- [ ] Admin credentials → Error + Logout ✅

### ✅ Admin Login Portal

- [ ] Admin credentials → Admin Dashboard ✅
- [ ] Citizen credentials → Error + Logout ✅
- [ ] Contractor credentials → Error + Logout ✅

### ✅ Dashboard Access

- [ ] Citizen accessing /dashboard/citizen → Success ✅
- [ ] Admin accessing /dashboard/citizen → Redirect to /dashboard/admin ✅
- [ ] Contractor accessing /dashboard/citizen → Redirect to /dashboard/contractor ✅

## Error Message Examples

### Login Portal Errors

```
❌ Access Denied: These credentials are for a CONTRACTOR account, not a Citizen account.
Please use the correct login portal or contact support if you believe this is an error.
```

### Dashboard Access Errors

```
❌ Access Denied: This dashboard is for citizens only. You are logged in as ADMIN.
Redirecting to your dashboard...

You will be redirected automatically in a few seconds...
```

### Technical Errors

```
❌ Error Loading Dashboard

Cannot connect to server. Please check if the backend is running on http://localhost:9050

Troubleshooting Tips:
• Check if the backend server is running on http://localhost:9050
• Verify your account has the CITIZEN role
• Try logging out and logging back in
• Clear your browser cache and cookies
• Contact support if the issue persists
```

## API Integration

No backend changes required. The fix uses existing backend responses:

```typescript
interface LoginResponse {
  token: string;
  userId: number;
  roles: string[]; // e.g., ['ROLE_CITIZEN']
}
```

The frontend now properly validates the `roles[0]` value before allowing access.

## Deployment Notes

1. **No Database Changes:** This is a frontend-only fix
2. **No API Changes:** Uses existing backend endpoints
3. **Backward Compatible:** Works with existing user accounts
4. **Immediate Effect:** No cache clearing required
5. **Zero Downtime:** Can be deployed without backend restart

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:

1. Multi-role support (users with multiple roles)
2. Role selection page for multi-role users
3. Enhanced audit logging on backend
4. Remember last used portal per user
5. Email notifications for failed login attempts

## Support Information

**If users encounter issues:**

1. **Wrong Portal Error:** Guide them to correct portal

   - Citizens → `/login/citizen`
   - Contractors → `/login/contractor`
   - Admins → `/login/admin`

2. **Role Mismatch:** Verify their account role in backend

   - Check `users` table `role` field
   - Should match their expected role

3. **Persistent Issues:** Check backend logs
   - Authentication endpoint: `/auth/login`
   - Look for role-related errors

## Conclusion

The role-based access control is now properly enforced at both the login portal and dashboard levels. Users receive clear, actionable error messages when attempting to access resources they don't have permission for, and the system automatically guides them to their appropriate dashboard.
